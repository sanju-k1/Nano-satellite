# 🛰️ Nano Satellite Sensor Logger

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is designed for logging environmental and motion data from various sensors connected to a microcontroller (e.g., Raspberry Pi Pico).  
The data is stored on an SD card in CSV format for further analysis.

---

## 🛠️ Features
- Reads data from:
  - **MQ2 Gas Sensor** (Smoke, LPG, Methane, Hydrogen)
  - **BMP280** (Pressure, Temperature)
  - **MPU6050** (Accelerometer & Gyroscope)
- Logs data with timestamps to SD card
- Auto-creates new CSV files to prevent overwriting
- Designed for Nano Satellite data acquisition
